# Overview of Project
This analysis was conducted to determine the statistical inner workings of the CitiBike program in New York City, in order to translate the program into a similar one in Des Moines.  Tableau was used to create visual representations of multiple datapoints, such as whether more males or females utilize CitiBike, what hours of the day are most popular for riding, and which parts of the city are most common beginning and end points for bike rides.

# Results
Below is a link to the Tableau story showing the results of the CitiBike data analysis.
* The first panel shows a map of the locations from which bike rides begin.  Locations are marked with circles, with larger circles representing more popular start points.
* The second panel shows a map of the locations at which bike rides end.  Locations are again marked with circles, with larger circles representing more popular end points.
* The third panel shows how many bikes are used for how long.  The Y axis shows the number of bikes and the X axis shows how long their rides last.  A filter is added to show how many minutes rides last by the hour, up to 24 hours.
* The fourth panel shows how many bikes are used for how long, filtered for the gender of the user.  The Y axis again shows the number of bikes while the X axis shows how long their rides last.  Separate lines on the graph represent the number of bikes used by males, females, or individuals of unknown gender.
* The fifth panel shows what time of day rides start by each day of the week.  The Y axis shows the hour of the day during which rides start and the X axis shows the day of the week the rides took place.  The darker the color on the heatmap indicates more rides started during that hour of the day.
* The sixth panel shows what time of day rides start by each day of the week, filtered for the gender of the user.  The Y axis again shows the hour of the day during which rides start and the X axis shows the day of the week the rides took place.  The darker the color on the heatmap indicates more rides started during that hour of the day.
* The seventh panel shows how many users are single-ride customers and how many are long-term subscribers to the program, filtered for both the gender of the user and the day of the week.  The Y axis shows the day of the week and the X axis shows the gender of the user.  The darker the color on the heatmap indicates a larger number of rides taken.

# Summary
These analyses show a few major conclusions.  First, it can be seen that significantly more males are using the CitiBike program in New York City than females, and significantly more users are long-term subscribers rather than single-ride customers.  Secondly, the vast majority of rides last about 10 minutes, and very few rides last longer than 30 minutes.  Also, the most rides take place between the hours of 6-9 AM and 5-7 PM on weekdays, and between 10-7 PM on weekends.  Further visualizations that could be useful might be to see how old most users are or which points during the year most rides take place.
